# Auto Pamoka

Auto enable pamoka solutions from your quick slot: Not need anymore, since Itos patch 25/06/2019. Keeping this function for now, because of Jtos.

Alert function: Popup an alert if you dont have any pamoka to fill when entering in your selected maps.

Type /autopamoka to open settings.

Little  bug: first time your login after opening the client, maybe the addon cant found pamoka solution because of the ui freeze. So if the alert is enabled maybe you got the msg(only if you login on your selected maps).
