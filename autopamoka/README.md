Auto enable pamoka solutions from your quick slot. Also have an alert function.

Type /autopamoka to open settings.

Little  bug: first time your login after opening the client, maybe the addon dont found pamoka solution because of the ui freeze. So if the alert is enabled maybe you got the msg(only if you login on your selected maps).
