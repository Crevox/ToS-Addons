# FPS Savior


Updated version of fpssavior from [FiftyCaliber](https://github.com/FiftyCaliber).

Removed a broken graphic option, added toggle button and new mode: "Medium".

**In "Ultra Low" mode, Players drawn is set to -100 which make the game try to not shown anyone besides you and remove all effects (skills included). Only recommended for world boss hunt**
