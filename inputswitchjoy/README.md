# Inputswitch Joystick

Inputswitch with support for joystick (all thanks to axjv for the base code).

/inputswitch kb for keyboard mode

/inputswitch mouse for mouse mode

/inputswitch ct for controler mode

Note: DONT WORK with axjv's input switcher, you need uninstall it first.

**For now I can't do this install by addon manager (working on fix), but you still can download the ipf file on my github page and manual copy to tos folder.
